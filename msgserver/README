A very simple websocket based message server which can be used to implement a range of applications from simple chat to multiplayer games.

The msg_server sends messages on a best effort basis. It is expected that ACK and message resends etc. are handled by the client applications.

The following properties are worth noting.

1: A message sent to a user who is not registered will result in a "sNotUser" message being sent back to the sending client.
2: Otherwise messages will be delivered unless the receiving client loses its connection with the server after the message has been handed off to the receiver's handling go-routine (i.e. it's *msgwriter.W)
3: Although the message bodies (msgdef.CMsgMsg and msgdef.SMsgMsg) have msgId and sendCnt fields these are for the client application's use only.
